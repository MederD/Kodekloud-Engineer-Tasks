The Nautilus DevOps team is adopting strict naming conventions for all IAM resources using Terraform. Theyâ€™ve asked for help enforcing lowercase, hyphenated names based on inputs like project and team.  
Your task as a DevOps engineer is to complete the following using Terraform:  
    Create an IAM User The user name must be derived using the format project-team-user, all lowercase, and non-alphanumeric characters (except dashes) replaced with -.  
    Create an IAM Role Use the same naming logic for the role name, ending in -role, and attach an assume role policy for EC2.  
    Tagging: Both resources must be tagged with:  
        Project: devops  
        Team: dev-team  
        ManagedBy: Terraform  
        Env: dev  
    Additionally, the IAM role should have:  
        RoleType: EC2  
    Use locals block within main.tf to:  
        Derive sanitized project/team names  
        Create the resource name prefix  
        Define reusable common tags  
    Create the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to provision the IAM Role & User as per the required values.  
    Use variables.tffile with the following:  
        KKE_PROJECT: name of the project(must be non-empty).  
        KKE_TEAM: name of the team (only letters, digits, dashes or underscores)  
        KKE_ENVIRONMENT: name of the environment  
    Use terraform.tfvarsfile to input the values.  
    Use outputs.tffile to output the following:  
        kke_user_name: name of the created user.  
        kke_role_name: name of the created role.  
        kke_tags_applied: tags applied to the IAM User.  

Solution:  
`main.tf:`  
```terraform
locals {
  project = lower(replace(replace(var.KKE_PROJECT, "[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]", "-"), "_", "-"))
  team    = lower(replace(replace(var.KKE_TEAM, "[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]", "-"), "_", "-"))
  name_prefix  = "${local.project}-${local.team}"

  common_tags = {
    Project   = local.project
    Team      = local.team
    ManagedBy = "Terraform"
    Env       = var.KKE_ENVIRONMENT
  }

  role_tags = merge(local.common_tags, { RoleType = "EC2" })
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "kke_user" {
  name = "${local.name_prefix}-user"
  tags = local.common_tags
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "kke_role" {
  name = "${local.name_prefix}-role"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Principal = { Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com" }
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]
  })
  tags = local.role_tags
}
```
