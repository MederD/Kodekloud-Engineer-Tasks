The Nautilus DevOps team is working on setting up some pre-requisites for an application that will send greetings to different users. There is a sample deployment that needs to be tested. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about it.  
  
1.) Create a pod named print-envars-greeting.  
2.) Configure spec as the container name should be print-env-container and use bash image.  
3.) Create three env vars:  
    a. GREETING and its value should be Welcome to  
    b. COMPANY and its value should be Stratos  
    c. GROUP and its value should be Ltd  
  
4.) Use command echo and configure args as ["$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"].  
5.) You can check the output by using <kubctl logs -f [ pod-name ]> command.  
  
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.  

Solution:  
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: print-envars-greeting
spec:
  containers:
  - name: print-env-container
    image: bash
    env:
    - name: GREETING
      value: "Welcome to"
    - name: COMPANY
      value: "Stratos"
    - name: GROUP
      value: "Ltd"
    command: ["echo"]
    args: ["$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"]
```
This solution is enough to pass the task, but it's not starting the container and giving 'CrashLoopBaskOff' error.
