The Nautilus DevOps team is trying to setup a simple Apache web server on all app servers in Stratos DC using Ansible. 
They also want to create a sample html page for now with some app specific data on it. 
Below you can find more details about the task.  

You will find a valid inventory file /home/thor/playbooks/inventory on jump host (which we are using as an Ansible controller).  

Create a playbook index.yml under /home/thor/playbooks directory on jump host.   
Using blockinfile Ansible module create a file facts.txt under /root directory on all app servers and add the following given block in it. You will need to enable facts gathering for this task.  

Ansible managed node IP is <default ipv4 address>  

(You can obtain default ipv4 address from Ansible's gathered facts by using the correct Ansible variable while taking into account Jinja2 syntax)  

Install httpd server on all apps. After that make a copy of facts.txt file as index.html under /var/www/html directory. Make sure to start httpd service after that.  

Note: Do not create a separate role for this task, just add all of the changes in index.yml playbook.  

Solution:  
Create index.yml:  
```  
---  
- hosts: stapp01, stapp02, stapp03
  gather_facts: True
  become: true
  tasks: 
  - blockinfile:
      create: yes
      path: /root/facts.txt
      block: |
        Ansible managed node IP is {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}
  - yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
  - service: 
      name: httpd
      state: started
  - file:
      path: /var/www/html/index.html
      state: touch
  - name: Copy document
    shell: cp /root/facts.txt /var/www/html/index.html
  - service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted
```
